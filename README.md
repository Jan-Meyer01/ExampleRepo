# ExampleRepo
Example Repository for learning Git basics.

## Setup
Setup this repo for your own:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jan-Meyer01/ExampleRepo
```

The following are already done for this, but for a new repo the next steps would be:
2. Copy your data from whatever folder into the repo folder called 'ExampleRepo'.

3. Commit your old code:
```
git add . 
git commit -m "Added old code"
```

4. Push your commit to the remote repo:
```
git push
```
